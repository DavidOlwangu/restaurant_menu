# 🍽️ Interactive Restaurant Menu Web App

A simple and beginner-friendly web application that dynamically displays a restaurant menu for **Breakfast**, **Main Course**, and **Dessert** using JavaScript.

This project focuses on learning how to render data on a web page using different looping techniques and basic DOM manipulation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Displays three menu categories:
  - Breakfast
  - Main Course
  - Dessert
- Automatically generates menu items on page load
- Uses different looping techniques for learning purposes
- Updates the web page dynamically without reloading
- Clean and simple structure suitable for beginners

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the menu layout and content
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For rendering menu items and updating the page dynamically

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- index.html  
- script.js  

---

## 📄 HTML File Description

The HTML file contains sections for:

- Breakfast menu
- Main course menu
- Dessert menu

Each section has a container where menu items are displayed dynamically by JavaScript.

The JavaScript file is linked at the bottom of the page to ensure the content loads before the script runs.

---

## 📖 How It Works

- Menu data is stored in JavaScript arrays.
- Each menu category is rendered using a different looping approach.
- The generated menu content is inserted into the correct section of the page.
- The browser displays the full restaurant menu automatically when the page loads.
